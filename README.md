📁 CYBERDOVE Portfolio

Hi, I'm Deking31—a cybersecurity enthusiast diving deep into cloud ops, ethical hacking, scripting, and endpoint defense. Through hands-on labs, I've tackled real-world challenges like deploying secure infra in Azure, running OSINT recon on global orgs, automating network diagnostics, and setting up SIEM agents. This repo showcases my projects, skills, and growth in the field. Open to collabs, junior roles, or feedback—hit me up on [X @Deking_31](https://x.com/Deking_31) or LinkedIn.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
Here's a snapshot of my lab work. Dive into each folder for code, write-ups, and visuals.

| Project | Description | Tech Stack | Key Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| [Azure Deployment](projects/azure-deployment/) | Customized ARM templates to deploy a scalable web app env, troubleshooting CLI auth and Arch Linux quirks. | Azure CLI, ARM JSON, SSH | Reduced setup time by 40%; secure, repeatable IaC for cloud teams. |
| [Recon Orgs](projects/recon-orgs/) | Passive OSINT on 8 high-profile targets (e.g., Visa, ICANN)—WHOIS, DNS, Shodan scans without a trace. | nmap, Google Dorks, WHOIS | Identified public exposures; honed ethical recon for pentest workflows. |
| [WiFi Speed Script](projects/wifi-speed-script/) | CLI tool for hourly speed logging with DB storage and trend plots—fixed syntax bugs for reliability. | Python (speedtest-cli, SQLite, Matplotlib) | Automated network troubleshooting; visualized anomalies for faster diagnostics. |
| [Wazuh Agent Setup](projects/wazuh-agent-setup/) | Installed and tuned Wazuh on Linux, resolving path/perms issues for real-time threat monitoring. | Wazuh, systemd, Bash | Enabled log forwarding to manager; boosted lab env security posture. |

## 🛠️ Skills Snapshot
Check [skills.md](skills.md) for the full rundown, but quick hits:
- **Cloud & IaC**: Azure (ARM, CLI), Docker basics
- **Scripting & Automation**: Python, Bash, Java snippets
- **Security Tools**: Wazuh, nmap, WireGuard VPN, OSINT frameworks
- **OS/DevOps**: Arch/Manjaro Linux, Git (incl. PAT auth fixes), pacman pkg mgmt

## 📜 Certifications & Badges
Building the stack—[certs-badges/README.md](certs-badges/README.md) tracks progress:
- CompTIA Security+ (in progress)
- Azure Fundamentals (target: Q1 2026)
- Badges: [Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Active%20Learner-brightgreen) \| [Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-Arch%20Pro-blue)

## 📈 Next Steps
- Adding CTF walkthroughs (e.g., Bandit levels).
- GitHub Pages site for a polished live view.
- Quantifying more impacts (e.g., "Detected X vulnerabilities via recon").

Star this repo if it vibes, and fork for your own tweaks. Let's secure the net together! 🌐💻
